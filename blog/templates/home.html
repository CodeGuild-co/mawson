                <h3>Amazing Mazes</h3>
                <p>On a rainy day in the summer holidays, I thought I would work on my maze program, a project I had been working on that would draw a maze from a file and then would calculate the best route. However, this route finding algorithm seemed a little boring so I set about creating a pseudo 3D maze engine that you could walk around in. 
                  For this foray into “3D” graphics I wanted to do it without the aid of Google, testing out my knowledge of the C# graphics class. While developing the solution, I was so pleased about how routines I had made previously for searching through the maze were very useful in the 3D part.
                <br>
                When drawing the maze, I took the direction the player was facing and then changed that into one of the cardinal directions that could be used to look at the array holding the maze data. By checking if a specific square had a wall or not, I could display the view to the user, also I used the same routine to check the collision detection of the player. This means the player can just use a keyboard with up to go forward, left and right to turn and the down arrow to backtrack.
                <br>
                While this sort of project would be more at home on the IBM PC, I felt a great sense of accomplishment that the whole project went together so well providing me a good base to work on future additions...

                <h3>Terrain</h3>
                <p>
                To generate some smooth looking terrain I have created a simple algorithm to randomly generate a set of points. The higher point is on the screen, the higher the chance of the next point being lower, ensuring there are hills but they don't continue all the way up to the top.
