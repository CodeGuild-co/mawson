Oooh a blog to write on, I have never written a blog, but the word sounds exciting. Blog sounds bit like frog and frogs are cool. Villiers Park seems to have good intentions so I should be safe here to write a blog. The food here look nice on the photos so they should be as good as they say in real life. I have never written in Python but have seen the program on my raspberry pi and it doesnâ€™t seem too scary. The group I am working with seem a nice enough bunch who should be willing to help in this snake filled Python world.
