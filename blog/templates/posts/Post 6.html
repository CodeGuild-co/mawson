Today, we went to the headquarters of ARM, the day didn't go completely to plan but atleast we had a good time
At first, we had a talk by a verification worker at ARM, showing us all of his rubiks cube solving lego robots. One, he didn't bring along could solve a cube in under 4 second.
Then we had a session of talking to different engineers at ARM to quiz them on the different jobs they did, and advice on the engineering jobs. We finally were supposed to be building and programming robtos, but only one turned up and that one didn't even work.
Overall, it was still a fun trip.
